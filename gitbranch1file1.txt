here with this we are going to learn git branching, working o branches and merge the branches into the main repo.
create a branch by git branch command, and use git checkout command to enter into the branch
orelse we can create and enter into the branch at a time by using git checkout -b branchname command
after checkout to a branch, we add few lines to a text file and save to do our practice.

Now we are adding few lines more here 
and we are going to work on git cherrypick command
by this command we can integrate the branch files into the master/main 


by using cherry-pick commit id command, till what ever the commits we need to integratte with the main, till that only we can integrate.
after the integration we can check the status and later we can push to remote repo from the main. 
we find the data in the remoterepo till the cherry-pick comit id data that is integrated from branch to the main
and the same pushed to the remote. But in the original branch file in the local repo can have additional commits,
which are not integratesd to the main branch.
