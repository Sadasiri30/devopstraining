here with this we are going to learn git branching, working o branches and merge the branches into the main repo.
create a branch by git branch command, and use git checkout command to enter into the branch
orelse we can create and enter into the branch at a time by using git checkout -b branchname command
after checkout to a branch, we add few lines to a text file and save to do our practice.

Now we are adding few lines more here 
and we are going to work on git cherrypick command
by this command we can integrate the branch files into the master/main
