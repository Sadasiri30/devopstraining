We are approximately 20 students come here to learn DevOps Tools
As part of that, we started to learn a first tool, ie GIT.

I have installed git on my PC, registered with username and useremail.
Signed up and logged into github.com, created a repo named devopstraining. 
Opened the gitbash on my PC, and cloned the remote repo with the repo url.

We have created a file named gitintro.txt and 6 lines of text and saved the file.
after saved the file, i have checked the status and committed as a first commit for gitintro.txt
Checked the status again and pushed the changes to remote repo.
