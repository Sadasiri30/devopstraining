I have created a new text file named gitintro2.txt and adding few lines in the file.
We are going for first commit

As we added few lines there in the remote repo and committed as remote commit 1
We checked here in local repo, ie through git bash it is showing that the working tree is clean. 
But, in the VSC it is showing sync 1 cahnges to pull the request from remote repo.
We added these lines in the local repo and try to add and commit now

Once we use the git add command here, it asks us to use pull requests from remote repo to update the local repo prior to use git cmmit commands
We stage the files initially in the git bash.
 So we are going to use git pull request to get the data from remote repo initially. and later we will commit.
