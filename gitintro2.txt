I have created a new text file named gitintro2.txt and adding few lines in the file.
We are going for first commit

As we added few lines there in the remote repo and committed as remote commit 1
We checked here in local repo, ie through git bash it is showing that the working tree is clean. 
But, in the VSC it is showing sync 1 cahnges to pull the request from remote repo.
We added these lines in the local repo and try to add and commit now

Once we use the git add command here, it asks us to use pull requests from remote repo to update the local repo prior to use git cmmit commands
We stage the files initially in the git bash.
 So we are going to use git pull request to get the data from remote repo initially. and later we will commit.

 
Now we are adding here few lines in the remote repo to test pusha and pull requests viceversa
and we will check the status in the gitbash for local repo, after the below mentioned commit.
now i am committing for these two lines in the remote repo, as gitintro2.txt remote commit 1

After all the commits done in the local repo, then only we are able to pull the requests from the remote server to the local repo
once we made pull requests in the git bash, we get options in the VSC to keep both the changes or to discard any from remote or local
